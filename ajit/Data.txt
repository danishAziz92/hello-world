of variations in transaction value impact the HLMs To meet the liquidity demands based on BASEL and local norms banks tend to prefer wholesale funding to fund deposits to counter the gap in returns due to investment in instruments with less returns as a result of which the inter bank lending rate is expected to rise due to increased demand of whole sale funds Increase in interbank lending rate would thus trigger increased income from floating interest tagged instruments Check and compare the variation of floating interest rates SIBOR SOR LIBOR etc with the movements in HLM LCR LDR NIM How does having periodical aperiodical payments and single pay out trades impact the HLMs There has been an increased investment in termed deposits for banks who have complied to LCR regulations also

payment frequencies H M Y etc with the movements of HLMs How do different length tenors or maturity period impact the HLMs Due increased investment in HQLA assets which are low return assets banks face a declining NIM As a counter strategy banks indulge in long term assets and benefit from the interest rate fluctuations as derivative trading using the long term asset which in return increases the NIM and also contributes to the HQLA assets for LCR significantly Evaluate the impact of variation in different tenor of instruments with the movements in HLM How does legal obligation towards schedule of payment impact the HLMs How does legal obligation towards amount of payment impact the HLMs Do groups formed based on deals made in the same country or in countries having similar macro economic factors have similar impact on HLMs Portfolio management Investment strategies Retail deposits in China and Singapore will have different run off rates as retail deposits in an economy can be

payoffs The payoff of a simple European or American style call or put option depends only on the value of the asset not on the path taken to get there A double barrier option has a lower barrier and an upper barrier which are the triggers to control the option s pay off and hedging capabilities Exotic Options such as Double barrier options offer more risk hedging capabilities due to the complex nature of their structure aimed at maximizing flexibility Check if the impact of plain vanilla trades and exotic trades vary differently with movement in HLM How do trades differ in their impact on HLMs across different levels of complexities with respect to multiple conditions in calculation of payoff Exotic Options are extremely hard to price and usually are very model dependent Since these are mostly traded through OTCs the opaque nature of OTC markets maintains the risky nature of these options as their risks are not always well known Careful hedging becomes a major issue and more

entities at all times Check if the impact of secured and unsecured trades vary differently with the movement in HLM How do various asset and mortgage backed securities differ in their impact on HLMs Banks might hold asset backed securities that are collateralized by accounts receivable Contracts require these banks to prefund the debt maturity in advance prior to the actual maturity date The prefunded amount is usually classified as restricted cash The rules related to these securities are not clear and there is no specific guidance for such a scenario The pre funding schedule impacts the outflow which can be either recorded at time of pre funding or can be recorded only at maturity depending on the bank s discretion This impact on in flow and out flow depending on type of security impacts the LCR Check the variation in impact of various asset and mortgage backed securities with movement in HLM Do trades being backed by hedging or insurance have a different impact on HLMs than

OperationsHow does having fluctuations in a transaction impact the HLMs How does nature of variations in transaction value impact the HLMs To meet the liquidity demands based on BASEL and local norms banks tend to prefer wholesale funding to fund deposits to counter the gap in returns due to investment in instruments with less returns as a result of which the inter bank lending rate is expected to rise due to increased demand of whole sale funds Increase in interbank lending rate would thus trigger increased income from floating interest tagged instruments Check and compare the variation of floating interest rates SIBOR SOR LIBOR etc with the movements in HLM LCR LDR NIM How does having periodical aperiodical payments and single pay out trades impact the HLMs There has been an increased investment in termed deposits for banks who have complied to LCR regulations also liquidity also LCR discourages short term funding and repo agreements as their contribution to meet the cash outflow requirements as per LCR norms is less or negligible Check and compare the variation of unscheduled scheduled and one time pay outs with movements in HLM How do trades with different payment frequencies impact the HLMs Banks need funds that don t expire in the days time frame so that it can account for the cash outflow as a result of which the bank s dependency on short term financing would decrease compared to long term financing Evaluate the impact of variation in different payment frequencies H M Y etc with the movements of HLMs How do different length tenors or maturity period impact the HLMs Due increased investment in HQLA assets which are low return assets banks face a declining NIM As a counter strategy banks indulge in long term assets and benefit from the interest rate fluctuations as derivative trading using the long term asset which in return increases the NIM and also contributes to the HQLA assets for LCR significantly Evaluate the impact of variation in different tenor of instruments with the movements in HLM How does legal obligation towards schedule of payment impact the HLMs How does legal obligation towards amount of payment impact the HLMs Do groups formed based on deals made in the same country or in countries having similar macro economic factors have similar impact on HLMs Portfolio management Investment strategies Retail deposits in China and Singapore will have different run off rates as retail deposits in an economy can be associated with factors like growth unemployment So deposits in DBS China could have more run off rates than deposits in DBS Singapore Check if the impact of trades from counterparties of different countries vary differently with movement in HLM How do the groups of deals formed based on combination of base and trading currency impact the HLMs A USD bond in Singapore and a USD bond in China could have different profitability reliability and volatility as the relationship of USD with SGD is different

in countries having similar macro economic factors capture essential features of the balance sheet without loss of information Various end users of the balance sheet data consume different metrics from the balance sheet like Tenor Discount rate Interest rate etc To check for loss of information and complexity we need to evaluate the groups based on these consumed metrics Check and compare the variance within the groups formed with the variance within the balance sheet data against each of these consumed metrics If the group shows a higher variation compared compared to the balance sheet data information is lost as a result of which business unit would no longer be able to consume the group of trade and hence the grouping cannot be done on these attributes Do the groups of deals

plain vanilla trades differ in their impact from trades having complexity in determination of payoffs The payoff of a simple European or American style call or put option depends only on the value of the asset not on the path taken to get there A double barrier option has a lower barrier and an upper barrier which are the triggers to control the option s pay off and hedging capabilities Exotic Options such as Double barrier options offer more risk hedging capabilities due to the complex nature of their structure aimed at maximizing flexibility Check if the impact of plain vanilla trades and exotic trades vary differently with movement in HLM How do trades differ in their impact on HLMs across different levels of complexities with respect to multiple conditions in calculation of payoff Exotic Options are extremely hard to price and usually are very model dependent Since these are mostly traded through OTCs the opaque nature of OTC markets maintains the risky nature of these options
